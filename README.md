# Nimiq Consensus

GitHub's LFS pricing is a joke.

Repository has been [moved to Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/bertramtruong/nimiq-consensus) where the pricing is more practical.

# Information

This repository *used to contain* a snapshot of the full consensus database of the Nimiq network to speed up the initial sync for full nodes.

If you don't know what this is, you most likely shouldn't need it.

Even, if you do know what this is -- you also most likely **shouldn't use it** as it's not officially endorsed by the Nimiq Network.

## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
